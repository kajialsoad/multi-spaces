    "project": "Multi Space App (App Cloner & Parallel Apps)",
    "date": "2025-08-17",
    "prepared_by": "Generated by Software Development Manager"
  },
  "product_overview": "Multi Space App enables users to clone installed apps on their Android device, allowing multiple parallel instances to run with isolated data and user environments. Leveraging Flutter for a friendly UI and native Android virtualization and sandboxing technologies for core cloning logic, the app facilitates seamless multi-account management securely and efficiently.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide ability to clone any installed app to multiple independent instances.",
    "Ensure complete data isolation between original and cloned app instances to prevent data leakage.",
    "Offer a user-friendly interface to browse installed apps, manage clones, and configure app preferences.",
    "Implement robust security features including data encryption and anti-tampering to protect cloned app data.",
    "Optimize performance to minimize memory and storage consumption while maintaining smooth user experience.",
    "Enable customization of cloned apps including icon and name modification for ease of identification.",
    "Ensure compliance with Google Play Store policies to avoid harmful app warnings and facilitate distribution."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "App Cloning: Create parallel app instances each with isolated data directories using Android virtualization and sandboxing.",
    "Virtual Space Management: Manage separate virtual environments for each cloned app instance ensuring full isolation.",
    "Data Isolation: Use separate SQLite databases and file system directories for cloned apps to secure user data.",
    "Security Management: Incorporate encryption, anti-tamper protection, and permission isolation for cloned instances.",
    "Performance Optimization: Monitor resource usage and implement memory optimizations to prevent leaks and ensure fast app launches.",
    "Home Screen Dashboard: Display cloned apps with icons and names in a grid layout for easy access.",
    "App List Management: Show all installed apps with search and selection ability to initiate cloning.",
    "Settings Management: Allow user preferences configuration including max instances, data encryption, and clone naming conventions.",
    "Hooking System: Runtime hooking to customize app behaviors within clones.",
    "Code Obfuscation: Protect proprietary code with obfuscation techniques against reverse engineering.",
    "Statistics Tracking: Track usage and performance metrics of cloned app instances.",
    "Account Management: Support management of multiple accounts across cloned apps.",
    "Auto Clone Detection: Automatically detect cloneable apps installed on the device.",
    "Clone Synchronization: Sync data between different cloned instances if required."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Launch app to home screen displaying all active cloned apps in a grid with icons and names.",
    "Navigate to app list screen to browse installed apps with search and select an app to clone.",
    "On clone request, Flutter sends package info via MethodChannel to native Android service handling cloning logic.",
    "Native service creates new virtual space with isolated data storage and registers new app instance.",
    "App instance appears on home screen dashboard with custom icon and name if specified.",
    "User can switch between cloned app instances or delete existing clones from home screen.",
    "Access settings screen to adjust clone limits, encryption settings, and customize clone naming patterns.",
    "Performance monitoring runs in background to optimize memory and resource usage across all clones.",
    "Statistics module collects app instance metrics and displays analytics in settings or debug screens.",
    "Debugging workflows include logcat monitoring, context switching verification, and virtual space usage tracking."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Successful cloning of any standard installed Android app without data leakage between instances.",
    "Each cloned app instance maintains separate data directories and SQLite databases without corruption.",
    "MethodChannel calls between Flutter UI and native Android components are reliable and performant.",
    "Security features such as encryption and anti-tamper protect cloned app data effectively.",
    "Custom icons and names for cloned apps are correctly displayed in the home dashboard.",
    "Performance benchmarks meet defined memory and CPU usage limits under typical multi-instance loads.",
    "All key user flows complete without crashes or functional errors on supported Android versions (min SDK 21 to target SDK 27).",
    "Compliance with Google Play Store requirements to avoid harmful app warnings and enable store distribution.",
    "Automated detection accurately identifies cloneable apps installed on the device.",
    "Synchronization operations between clones complete successfully without data loss or inconsistency."
