## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

### Requirement: App Cloning Functionality
- **Description:** Core app cloning features including creating parallel instances with isolated data directories and SQLite databases.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC001
- **Test Name:** Clone installed app successfully
- **Test Code:** [TC001_Clone_installed_app_successfully.py](./TC001_Clone_installed_app_successfully.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify cloning of a standard installed Android app could not be completed because the Multi Space App interface was not accessible. Attempts to access the app directly failed, and searching for the app was blocked by a CAPTCHA page on Google. Without access to the app, the cloning steps and verification could not be performed.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/5d82f7fc-0a3c-4aa2-89a1-e8f718fb5c61/f3ca5084-786f-40fb-9026-e2952b1d440f
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** High
- **Analysis / Findings:** The test failed because the Multi Space App interface was not accessible, likely due to the local server not running or network restrictions causing a CAPTCHA block on Google searches. This prevented accessing the app and performing cloning verification.
